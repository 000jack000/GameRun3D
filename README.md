# GameRun3D

Time: I had some issues with Git, im used to source tree directly.. but more or less, with a break in the middle and not counting the git time 4 hours

dificulties: the game was pretty straight forward to code, the timings to make things trilling and fun maybe were the part where i had to think more

Better: in general Level design could be a bit better

Upgrades: i was coding everything in modules, the idea was to make everything procedural (not really hard) so every level could be a bit diferent

after 4 hours and a battle with git, i don't think anymore! It was fun to do. I tought about the color mode after finishing the first level of the normal one, I tried to make things a bit different with the same core mechanic and the same puzzles.

Had to install the version of unity at the begining cuz i was working with a different one! i did the game design in that time, i have some sketches in my notebook if you want them ;P
